Replacement stereo cameras for OAK-D-PCBA
************************************

These modules are compatible with the OAK-D-PCBA.  Because the OAK-D is preassembled, the cameras are affixed to the board and cannot easily be removed without damage.

- Compact Camera Module (CCM) Fish-Eye OV9282 (for better SLAM) `here <https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-1mp-ov9282-fisheye-mono-global-shutter-drop-in-replacement-for-depthai-oak-dnoir/>`__
- Mechanical, Optical, and Electrical equivalent OV9282 module with visible and IR capability `here <https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-1mp-ov9282-ccm-drop-in-replacement-for-oak-d/>`__
- Global-Shutter Color Camera (OV9782) with same intrinsics as OV9282 grayscale `here <https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-1mp-ov9782-color-global-shutter-drop-in-replacement-for-depthai-oak-dnoir-b0352/>`__
- C/CS-Mount IMX283 (1" diagonal sensor, which is huge) `here <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/issues/30>`__ is in progress.
